## What it is
A simple Unix shell inspired by Bash.  
It has proper signal handling, environment variables handling, process forking, and working history.  
Supports redirection, pipes, heredoc, subshell commands,  && and ||, and some other stuff.

Succeeded with 125%

## Skills
 - Imperative programming
 - Unix
 - Rigor


## How it works
Requisites:
```shell
gcc libreadline-dev
```

After compiling it, run ./minishell, and you'll be inside it.  
It can be used normally as a daily shell, but I wouldn't recommend it.
